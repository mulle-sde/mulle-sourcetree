... for Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Windows

Organize your projects freely with multiple archives and repositories.

#### Capabilities

* maintains local (file, folder) or external tree nodes (archive, repository)
* can decorate tree nodes with marks (flags), which can be queried later
* can store an arbitrary binary blob with each node as userinfo
* can deal with sourcetrees within sourcetrees (recursive operation)
* can share common dependendies of sourcetrees (share operation)
* can walk the sourcetree with qualifiers
* supports the repair of the sourcetree after manual filesystem changes
* can symlink other local projects

#### What this enables you to do

* build sub-projects in the correct order
* build platform specifica without #ifdef or complicated Makefiles
* acquire dependencies unique to each platform
* avoid duplicate edits in shared projects
