Organize your projects freely with multiple archives and repositories.

* embed remote files into your project
* acquire dependencies unique to each platform
* override external dependencies with symlinks to local copies
* build sub-projects in the correct order
* create platform specific #ifdefs and #include statements
* create platform specific linker statements
* inherit dependencies from other sourcetrees

## Sourcetree Nodes

A sourcetree is a list of nodes. A node typically has a representation
in the filesystem. An easy example is a node called `zlib`, that is present
in the project as a folder called `zlib`.

A node consists of nine different fields. The most important fields are

* the address, which is its place in the project filesystem
* the nodetype, which distinguishes between local subprojects, remote repositories, operating system libraries and the like
* the url, which is used to identify and possibly retrieve a repository or archive for this node.

A node can also be decorated with various "marks" (see below) and can carry
a user-defined "userinfo" payload.

These are the fields of a node:

| Field          | Required | Description                                           |
|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------ |
| `address`      | YES      | Name of the node and relative position in the project |
| `branch`       | NO       | Repository branch (git)                               |
| `fetchoptions` | NO       | Values to be passed to mulle-fetch.                   |
| `marks`        | NO       | Marks of the node                                     |
| `nodetype`     | YES      | Type of node                                          |
| `tag`          | NO       | Tag (git/github archive)                              |
| `url`          | NO       | URL of node.                                          |
| `userinfo`     | NO       | Userinfo of node, can be binary!                      |
| `uuid`         | NO       | Internal node identifier. Don't touch, don't copy!    |


The fields "nodetype", "branch", tag", "url", "fetchinfo" are expandable.
Which means that environment variables affect their contents. The expansion
order is "branch" and "tag", then "url" and finally "fetchinfo". The expanded
contents are available through the following variables:

| Variable              | Description                                        |
| ----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `MULLE_BRANCH`        | expanded contents of "branch"                      |
| `MULLE_TAG`           | expanded contents of "tag"                         |
| `MULLE_TAG_OR_BRANCH` | expanded contents of "tag" or if empty of "branch" |
| `MULLE_URL`           | expanded contents of "url"                         |

You can thus override project versions and URLs of inherited dependencies, if
they participate in this scheme. This allows you to substitute github release
URLs with some intermediate testing ones for instance for example.

This is the canonical way to specify a sourcetree dependency in mulle-sde.
It allows you to override the version (ZLIB_TAG) and the host of the archive
(ZLIB_URL) to download the desired archive.

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree add \
   --nodetype tar \
   --tag '${ZLIB_TAG:-2.0.0}' \
   --url '${ZLIB_URL:-https://github.com/madler/zlib/archive/${MULLE_TAG}.tar.gz}' \
   external/zlib
```

### dependencies and benefactors

So your project "your-project" just added "zlib" as a dependency with the
above command. So `your-project/.mulle/etc/sourcetree/config` now
contains a node "zlib".

Another project, "their-project", can be the benefactor of the node "zlib".
For that it makes "your-project" a dependency. So
`their-project/.mulle/etc/sourcetree/config` now a node referencing
"your-project". Or just in other words "your-project" bequeathes "zlib" to
"their-project".


## Sourcetree Nodetypes

These are the known nodetypes. In addition to `address` and `nodetype` some
of the other fields may be used or ignored, depending on the nodetype.

| Nodetype  | Url | Branch | Tag | Fetchoptions | Description                                    |
|-----------|-----|--------|-----|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `commment`| NO  | NO     | NO  | NO           | used to comment the sourcetree                 |
| `git`     | YES | YES    | YES | YES          | git repository                                 |
| `local`   | NO  | NO     | NO  | NO           | used for subprojects                           |
| `svn`     | YES | YES    | NO  | YES          | svn repository                                 |
| `symlink` | YES | NO     | NO  | NO           | symbolic link                                  |
| `tar`     | YES | NO     | YES | YES          | tar archive. fetchoptions enable check shasum integrity |
| `zip`     | YES | NO     | YES | YES          | zip archive. fetchoptions enable check shasum integrity |

> `zip` and `tar` use the tag through expansion (see above). If the URL isn't
> properly fashioned, setting the tag will have no affect.


## Sourcetree Marks

A node of a sourcetree can have a variety of pre-defined and user-defined
"marks".  By default a node has **all** marks, even those marks, which
haven't been invented yet. You can selectively
remove a mark by adding the mark prefixed with "no-".
An exception are marks that are prefixed with "only-".

### supermarks

Supermarks are macros for marks. Supermarks are only used for the user
interface. Internally only marks are considered.


| Supermark      | Description
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C              | C language                                                           |
| Embedded       | Fetch dependency and place into the project but don't craft it       |
| HeaderLess     | A dependency that provides no include files                          |
| HeaderOnly     | A dependency that only provides include files                        |
| HeaderPrivate  | The include files of this library are not shared with the benefactor |
| Info           | This is a project that gets crafted but it provides only assets      |
| Library        | A system library                                                     |
| LinkForce      | This library or dependency must be force linked `--all-load`         |
| LinkLeaf       | This dependency is free of linkable inferior dependencies (Optimization) |
| LinkStaticToExe| This dependency or library must only (statically) be linked with executables |
| Local          | Like Embedded but it's never fetched (Obscure)                       |
| ObjC           | Objective-C language                                                 |
| Optional       | A dependency that need not exist for the craft to succeed            |
| Serial         | The dependency can not partake in mulle-craft three-phase builds     |
| Startup        | This is a dependency that gets only linked with executables          |
| Subproject     | A craftable embedded project, that is never fetched                  |
| Tool           | Produces an executable                                               |
| TreeLeaf       | This dependency has no mulle-sourcetree (Optimization)               |
| TreePrivate    | Do not bequeath this node to a benefactor                            |
| UnknownLanguage| Actually empty, used as a placeholder in output                      |


To see the expanded values use:

``` sh
for i in `mulle-sourcetree supermark list`
do
   echo "$i;`mulle-sourcetree supermark decompose $i`"
done
```

You can expand the list of supermarks by writing a mulle-sourcetree plugin.
Ideally a user only needs to interact with supermarks.

### marks used by mulle-sourcetree

These are a list of marks that are interpreted by mulle-sourcetree during
"sync":

| Mark              | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `basename`        | Use last path component of the address for share test    |
| `bequeath`        | Node should be used by parent project.                   |
| `descend`         | An inferior sourcetree within this node will be used.    |
| `fs`              | The node has/should have a corresponding file or folder. |

| `share`           | The node is shareable with other sourcetree nodes.       |
| `share-shirk`     | If disabled no-share nodes can squat the share test      |
| `update`          | The node will be updated after an initial fetch.         |

and during "clean":

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `delete`          | Can be deleted in a `mulle-sourcetree clean`.            |



### marks used by mulle-sourcetree-to-c

mulle-sourcetree-to-c is used to generate `#include` or `#import`
statements to be included by the project. The output of mulle-sourcetree-to-c
is self documenting!

| Mark                     | Description                                                  |

### marks used by mulle-sourcetree-to-cmake

mulle-sourcetree-to-cmake is used to generate cmake files for linking.
The output of mulle-sourcetree-to-cmake is also self documenting!

| Mark                         | Description                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all-load`                   | Will be linked "wholesale" for Objective-C.                 |

Then there are some marks, that are used by mulle-sde tools.
[mulle-craft](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-craft) utilizes a number of
marks to control the build process.
[mulle-sde](https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde) queries the marks during
the generation of the linkorder and the craftorder. See the respective
READMEs for more information.



#### Sourcetree Modes

| Mode        | Description                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--flat`    | Only the local sourcetree nodes are updated.                       |
| `--recurse` | Subtrees of nodes are also updated.                                |
| `--share`   | Like recurse, but nodes with identical URLs are only fetched once. |

Generally you will use `--share` - the default - for minimal hassle.


## Commands

User interaction with the mulle-sourcetree is usually indirect through
[mulle-sde](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde). But mulle-sde exposes only
exposes a small part of the mulle-sourcetree functionality.

See all available commands with `mulle-sourcetree help`. Almost all commands
will show a help page with `mulle-sourcetree <command> help`. What follows
is a presentation of some common commands:


### `mulle-sourcetree add` : add nodes with

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree add \
   --url https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/archive/R_2_2_5.tar.gz \
   external/expat
```

You can specify your URL with environment variables (with fallback values), to
make the sourcetreee more flexible:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree add
   --url '${ZLIB_URL:-https://github.com/madler/zlib.git}' \
   external/zlib
```

### `mulle-sourcetree json` : see sourcetree

The JSON sourcetree representation gives a nice overview, over its contents:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree json
[
   {
      "address":      "external/expat",
      "nodetype":     "tar",
      "url":          "https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/archive/R_2_2_5.tar.gz",
      "uuid":         "87DFF521-D6FB-4621-8CEB-713E3B495EFA"
   },
   {
      "address":      "external/zlib",
      "nodetype":     "git",
      "url":          "${ZLIB_URL:-https://github.com/madler/zlib.git}",
      "uuid":         "974C7DFA-A353-43D8-871F-3CFF7ADC1E22"
   }
]
```


### `mulle-sourcetree sync` : fetch and update nodes

After changing the sourcetree, run *sync* to reflect the changes back
into your project by fetching added and deleting removed dependencies:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree sync
```


### `mulle-sourcetree list` : stay in control

See your sourcetree with **list**:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree list --output-header --output-eval
address         nodetype  marks  userinfo  url
-------         --------  -----  --------  ---
external/expat  tar                        https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/archive/R_2_2_5.tar.gz
external/zlib   git                        https://github.com/madler/zlib.git
```

Use custom format options to retrieve the information you want. This example
lists all the URLs definitions used in your project:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree list -r \
                        --format "%u\n" \
                        --output-no-header \
                        --output-no-indent \
| sed -n 's/^\${\([A-Z_]*\):-\(.*\)}$/\1=\"\2\"/p' \
| sort -u
```

### `mulle-sourcetree move` : change node order

The order in which dependencies are build or libraries are linked can be
important.

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree move external/zlib top
```


### `mulle-sourcetree dotdump` : picture your sourcetree

Get a graphical overview with **dotdump**. The output format is the
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) `.dot` format. Use `dot` to convert it to
PNG or SVG:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree dotdump --td > pic.dot
dot -Tsvg -o pic.svg pic.dot     #
open pic.svg
```

![Picture](doc/pic.png)

Or try `mulle-sourcetree-graph` for a more abstract view.

### `mulle-sourcetree craftorder` : retrieve projects to build

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree craftorder
/private/tmp/a/external/expat
/private/tmp/a/external/zlib
```

### `mulle-sourcetree-import-json` : edit the sourcetree config as JSON

You can edit the JSON output from `mulle-sourcetree-json` and import it back
with:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree-import-json
```


### `mulle-sourcetree-edit-csv` : edit the sourcetree config with a spreadsheet

These commands need sqlite3 and a spreadsheet editor installed:

``` bash
mulle-sourcetree-edit-csv
mulle-sourcetree-export-csv
mulle-sourcetree-import-csv
mulle-sourcetree-import-sqlite
```

## Install

See [mulle-sde-developer](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer) how to
install mulle-sde, which will also install mulle-sourcetree with required
dependencies.

The command to install only the latest mulle-sourcetree into
`/usr/local` (with **sudo**) is:

``` bash
curl -L 'https://github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sourcetree/archive/latest.tar.gz' \
