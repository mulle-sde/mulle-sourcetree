Organize your projects freely with multiple archives and repositories.

* maintain local (file, folder) or external tree nodes (archive, repository)
* inherit sourcetrees from dependencies
* override external dependencies with symlinks of local projects
* give build sub-projects in the correct order
* create platform specific #ifdefs and #include statements
* acquire dependencies unique to each platform
